# Hi, I'm Vinodh Raju

I am a Software Engineer and current Computer Science Master’s student at **Portland State University**. 

My background is in **Systems Engineering**, where I spent over two years at **Infosys** managing secure infrastructure for global enterprise partners. Currently, I’m focused on building cloud-native applications that sit at the intersection of high-scale backend development and robust security.

### What I’m working on
* **Cloud-Native AI:** Recently built a location-intelligence engine using FastAPI and Gemini AI, containerized with Docker and scaled on Google Cloud Run.
* **Security & Pentesting:** Active on TryHackMe; recently completed a full-cycle penetration test on the Ultratech machine, focusing on Docker escapes and privilege escalation.
* **Infrastructure as Code:** Moving away from manual configuration toward automated deployments using Terraform and CI/CD pipelines.

### My Technical Stack
* **Languages:** Python (Primary), Java, C++, SQL, Bash.
* **Cloud/DevOps:** AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Cloud Build.
* **Security & Networking:** Palo Alto Firewalls, VPN/IPSec, Nmap, Wireshark.
* **Backend Frameworks:** FastAPI, Flask, Node.js.

### Industry Experience
Before starting my MS at PSU, I was a **Senior Systems Engineer at Infosys**. I managed secure connectivity for over 1,000 business partners. My biggest win there was automating ServiceNow workflows which cut down our manual provisioning time by **40%**.
